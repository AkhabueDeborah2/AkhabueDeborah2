# Mission :dart:

To improve clinical outcomes, operational efficiency, and research insight in healthcare by applying data-driven analysis grounded in real-world clinical experience.

# About Me :woman_technologist:

I am a DataCamp Certified Data Analyst and a Senior Perioperative Nurse with over 15 years of experience working in real healthcare environments. My work sits at the intersection of clinical practice, healthcare operations, and data analytics.

Before learning SQL and Python, I was already working with audits, reports, documentation, workflow reviews, and outcome tracking. Analytics gave structure and clarity to work I had been doing informally for years. Today, I use data to help healthcare teams understand what is happening in their systems and where improvement is possible.

I am particularly interested in projects that connect analytics to patient safety, operational efficiency, and evidence-based decision-making.
